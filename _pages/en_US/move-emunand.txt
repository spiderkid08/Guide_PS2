title: "Move EmuNAND"
---

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### Required Reading

This is an add-on section for moving the contents of a previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, then removing the old EmuNAND partition. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

Note that if you have any payload files other than `GodMode9.firm` in the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card, holding (Start) on boot will display a "chainloader menu" where you will have to use the D-Pad and the (A) button to select "GodMode9" for these instructions.

You MUST have already installed Luma3DS and boot9strap to use this.
