title: "Region Changing"

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### Required Reading

This is add-on section for region changing your CFW SysNAND. This is done by installing the 11.5.0 CTRTransfer image for the region you want to switch to.

Note that region changing is almost completely unnecessary since Luma3DS supports out-of-region games and individual [title region emulation](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/wiki/Options-and-usage).

To use the [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download).

Note that if you have any payload files other than `GodMode9.firm` in the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card, holding (Start) on boot will display a "chainloader menu" where you will have to use the D-Pad and the (A) button to select "GodMode9" for these instructions. 

This process will unlink your NNID from the system, since it will no longer be compatible with it. NNID's are locked to the region of your device that created them and cannot be transferred between regions without [a very complex and advanced process](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/yifanlu/e80db121d38aceb8cca0e03cefd5853b/raw/3c4dd89869156ca0f945a2791e699acfdb32b510/gistfile1.txt).
{: .notice--warning}

After this process, only **New 3DSs which have never accessed the eShop before** and **all Old 3DSs** will be able to access the eShop after creating a new NNID on their new region. Region changed New 3DSs that have already accessed the eShop on their original region cannot create a new NNID and access the eShop on their new region!
{: .notice--warning}

Note that occasionally the eShop will inexplicably still not work for devices that it should work for. This is entirely to do with Nintendo's servers, and I really do not have any control over it. Additionally, note that occasionally the eShop will inexplicably work for devices that it should not (such as some New 3DSs). The cause for this is currently unknown.

Region changing using CTRTransfer (which this method uses) seems to cause reboot patches to break. The cause for this is unknown, but Old 3DS users, for now, will be unable to play extended memory mode games (such as Monster Hunter, Super Smash Bros, and Pok√©mon Sun / Moon) until they format their devices.

You MUST have already installed Luma3DS and boot9strap to use this.
