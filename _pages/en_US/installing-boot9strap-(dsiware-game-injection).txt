### Required Reading

Note that if you have any payload files other than `GodMode9.firm` in the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card, holding (Start) on boot will display a "chainloader menu" where you will have to use the D-Pad and the (A) button to select "GodMode9" for these instructions. 

To use the [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download).

To extract the `.7z` files linked on this page, you will need a file archiver like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/).

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the notices and warnings on [Installing boot9strap (DSiWare)](installing-boot9strap-(dsiware))

If you do not use the correct `.firm` corresponding to the target 3DS, you will BRICK! Ensure you download and use the correct one!

1. Press (Y) on the DSiWare injection `.app` to copy it
1. Press (B) to go back to the main menu
1. Navigate to `SYSNAND TWLN` -> `title` -> `00030004` -> `(8 Character ID)`

  + If your game has an error about corrupted or inaccessible save data, confirm that you copied **the contents of** the `savedata` folder and not the `savedata` folder itself
  + If your game behaves normally and does not give you an error about `boot.nds`, then you should stop and figure out what went wrong
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#dsi--ds-functionality-is-broken-after-completing-the-guide)

#### Section III - System Transfer

1. If **the target 3DS** has a Nintendo Network ID on it, you must format the device using System Settings:
  + Go to the last page of "Other Settings" and select "Format System Memory", then follow all instructions
1. Read the following:
  + Your CFW 3DS = the source 3DS = "Source System"
  + Your Stock 3DS = the target 3DS = "Target System"
  + **Move DSiWare titles if prompted!**
  + Do **NOT** delete the source system's SD card contents if prompted
  + Make sure neither device's battery dies during the transfer
  + **Old 3DS or Old 2DS (source) to New 3DS or New 2DS (target) only**: if asked which method you wish to use to transfer the SD card data:
    + **Do NOT** choose the "Low-Capacity microSD Card Transfer" or minimal option (option 2), it will only transfer tickets and likely will not transfer the DSiWare save.
    + Fast Method: If you have the ability to move the data from the SD card (source) to the microSD card (target), when prompted use the "PC-Based Transfer" option (option 3).
    + Slowest Method: If you don't have the ability to move the data on a PC use the **full** "Wireless Transfer" option (option 1).

1. Do one of the following
    + Do the rest of the sections and then the full guide on **the target 3DS**, then wait one week *(do not restore your NAND backup before system transferring)*, then System Transfer from **the target 3DS** back to **the source 3DS** *(remember you cannot transfer back from a New 3DS or New 2DS to an Old 3DS or Old 2DS)*
    + Call Nintendo and tell them you no longer have access to the device that your NNID is linked to (which is **the target 3DS** in this case), and would like it linked to a different device (which is **the source 3DS** in this case)
    + You can also just [remove the NNID](godmode9-usage#removing-an-nnid-without-formatting-your-device) from **the source 3DS** if you'd prefer it remain on **the target 3DS**
1. Reboot **the source 3DS** while holding (Start) to launch GodMode9
1. Navigate to `[0:] SDCARD` -> `gm9` -> `out`
1. Press (A) on `<date>_<serialnumber>_sysnand_###.bin` to select it, then select "NAND image options...", then select "Restore SysNAND (safe)"
1. Press (A) to unlock SysNAND overwriting, then input the key combo given
  + This will not overwrite your boot9strap installation
1. Input the key combo given to unlock SysNAND (lvl1) writing
  + This process will take some time
1. Once it has completed, press (A) to continue
1. Press (A) to relock write permissions if prompted
1. Press (Start) to reboot **the source 3DS**

#### Section V - Flashing the target 3DS's FIRM

1. Exit b9sTool, then power off your device
  + You may have to force power off by holding the power button
1. Power on **the target 3DS**
1. Put your SD card in your computer, then copy `BACKUP.bin` from the `boot9strap` folder to a safe location on your computer
  + Make backups in multiple locations (such as online file storage)
  + This backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong in the future
1. Reinsert your SD card into **the target 3DS**
1. Power on **the target 3DS**

#### Section VI - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Boot your device while holding (Select) to launch the Luma configuration menu
